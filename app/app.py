# Add a start route calculation button, which triggers the execution of all my functions below

## ----- Calculate route ------
# copy paste the code from routing.py here (from line 288-320)




## ----- Plot map and route -------
# Copy paste the route plotting from my notebook here and try to show it on the website + the route statistics (length and time)
